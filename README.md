# OpenAI ConversationalAI in Node.js

ConversationalAI test in Python with GPT-3 in the CLI

## Running
Install TypeScript globally (ignore if already installed)
```
npm install typescript@latest -g
```
Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
If you make changes to any TypeScript files in `src/` it helps to run the watcher which auto-complies them to JS as you save.
```
tsc -w
```
Then, run `ts-built/ai.js`
```
node ts-built/ai.js
```
